# Me Want That - Flutter Frontend

This piece of software is a mobile application, built with Google's Native Cross Platform Framework Flutter. It started 2020 as an example for a Masterthesis about Mobile Cross Platform Development (Tag v2.0). 

## Prerequisites

You're going to need Flutter installed and available on your commandline. I recommend Android Studio with Flutter/Dart Plugin as preferred IDE.

## Some useful commmands

```bash
flutter packages get
```

```bash
flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

```bash
flutter pub global activate devtools
```

```bash
flutter pub global run devtools
```

```bash
flutter run
```
